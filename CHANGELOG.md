## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.4] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Critical: @ParameterizedTest name mismatch** - Fixed bug where parameterized tests would show "No active test found" and stay in "RUNNING" state forever
  - Root cause: `getTestDisplayName()` was falling back to method name instead of using `context.getDisplayName()` which includes parameter values
  - Now correctly uses context display name for @ParameterizedTest, @RepeatedTest, and all test templates
  - Example: `"1: Test with params [value1] [value2]"` now matches correctly between start and complete

## [1.2.3] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed (Code Review Feedback)
- **DRY: Primitive array formatters** - Extracted common logic into `formatPrimitiveArrayGeneric()` using `IntFunction<String>`, eliminating duplicate code across 8 overloads
- **Security: setAccessible() handling** - Added graceful handling for Java 17+ module restrictions (`InaccessibleObjectException`), with debug logging instead of silent failures
- **Robustness: Video filename extraction** - Video attachments now use actual filename from path (e.g., `test-video.webm`) instead of hardcoded `video.webm`
- **Robustness: Null checks** - Added null check for video path supplier return value to prevent NPE
- **Robustness: parseRetryInfo null safety** - Returns empty string instead of null displayName to prevent downstream NPEs
- **Constants: Configurable limits** - Extracted magic numbers to named constants:
  - `MAX_ARG_LENGTH = 200` - Step argument truncation limit
  - `MAX_ARRAY_ITEMS = 5` - Array items before truncation
- **Duplicate artifact prevention** - Added `SCREENSHOT_CAPTURED` and `TRACE_CAPTURED` thread-local flags to prevent duplicate attachments when both M00nExtension and base test classes attempt to capture artifacts

### Added
- `M00nPlaywright.isScreenshotCaptured()` - Check if screenshot already captured for current test
- `M00nPlaywright.isTraceCaptured()` - Check if trace already captured for current test
- `M00nPlaywright.markScreenshotCaptured()` - Mark screenshot as captured (for manual capture)
- `M00nPlaywright.markTraceCaptured()` - Mark trace as captured (for manual capture)

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Automatic Playwright artifact capture** - Screenshots and traces captured on test failure:
  - Works with ANY custom base test class or extension (no inheritance required!)
  - Artifacts captured IMMEDIATELY on failure, BEFORE any `@AfterEach` runs
  - Compatible with custom extensions that close browser in teardown
- **Zero-config Playwright detection** - No code changes needed!
  - Auto-detects `Page` and `BrowserContext` fields via reflection
  - Just add dependency + config file, run tests
  - Scans class hierarchy (parent classes too)
- **`PlaywrightTestProvider` interface** - Optional explicit contract:
  - Implement `getPage()` and `getContext()` if you prefer explicit registration
  - Useful for wrapper classes like `MainPage`
- **`M00nPlaywright` utility class** - Alternative manual registration API:
  - `M00nPlaywright.setPage(page)` - enables screenshot capture on failure
  - `M00nPlaywright.setContext(context)` - enables trace capture on failure
  - Uses reflection to avoid compile-time Playwright dependency
- **`M00nPlaywrightExtension`** - Optional extension for video capture:
  - Only needed if you want video recording (requires context close first)
- **`@Step` placeholder support** - Step titles now support parameter placeholders:
  - `{paramName}` - replaced with parameter value by name (e.g., `@Step("Opening {url}")`)
  - `{0}`, `{1}`, `{2}` - replaced with parameter value by index
  - Long strings (>200 chars) are automatically truncated
  - Arrays are formatted nicely with item count
- **`@ParameterizedTest` compatibility** - Parameterized tests now work correctly with unique test names

### Fixed
- **Critical: Incorrect retry count detection** - Fixed bug where parameterized test invocation numbers (e.g., `#599`, `#1599`) were incorrectly interpreted as retry attempts
- Retry detection now ONLY matches explicit "Attempt N" patterns from JUnit Pioneer's `@RetryingTest`
- `[test-template-invocation:#N]` patterns in unique IDs are no longer treated as retry indicators
- Tests without `@RetryingTest` now correctly show retry=0 instead of high invocation numbers

## [1.2.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **@RetryingTest compatibility** - Fixed "NamespacedHierarchicalStore cannot be modified after it has been closed" error
- Attachments now display correctly when using `@RetryingTest` with retries
- Used thread-local tracking instead of extension context store for reported status
- Added safe fallback when accessing test context after store closure

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Bundled `aop.xml`** - Users no longer need to create their own AspectJ configuration file
- **Transitive AspectJ runtime** - `aspectjrt` is now included automatically

### Changed
- Simplified setup - only need to add `aspectjweaver` dependency and `-javaagent`
- Updated documentation to reflect zero-config AspectJ approach

### Removed
- Manual `aop.xml` creation requirement (it's bundled in the JAR)
- Manual `aspectjrt` dependency requirement (it's transitive now)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **AspectJ-based step tracking** - Automatic `@Step` interception without StepProxy or PageFactory
- `M00nStepAspect` for load-time weaving of `@Step` annotated methods
- Zero-boilerplate step tracking - just annotate methods and they're tracked!

### Changed
- Recommended approach is now AspectJ (simpler, no factory classes needed)
- Updated documentation to reflect AspectJ-first approach
- Updated all examples to use concrete classes instead of interfaces

### Deprecated
- `StepProxy.create()` - still works but AspectJ is recommended
- Interface-based Page Objects - concrete classes are simpler with AspectJ

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Initial release of M00n JUnit 5 Reporter
- Real-time test result streaming via WebSocket
- JUnit 5 extension with automatic registration via ServiceLoader

### Step Tracking
- `@Step` annotation for Page Object methods
- `StepProxy.create()` for manual step tracking (legacy approach)
- Steps appear in M00n Report with timing and status
- Manual step API via `TestResult.addStep()`

### Retry Support
- Full support for JUnit Pioneer's `@RetryingTest`
- Each retry attempt tracked separately
- Flaky test detection and marking

### Attachments
- Screenshot attachment via `AttachmentData.screenshot()`
- Video attachment via `AttachmentData.video()`
- Trace attachment via `AttachmentData.trace()`
- Log attachment via `AttachmentData.log()`
- Generic file attachment via `AttachmentData.file()`
- Async upload with retry logic

### Playwright Integration
- `M00nStep.current()` for current test access
- `M00nStep.isCurrentTestFailed()` for conditional artifact capture
- Base test class pattern for artifact capture

### Configuration
- `m00n.properties` file configuration
- Environment variable support
- System property overrides
- Multiple configuration sources with precedence
